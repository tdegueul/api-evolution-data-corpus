% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
Development of independently released software components is nowadays widely supported by tools.
Among other benefits, the tools help guarantee backward compatibility of new versions of components. 
In other words, non-breaking changes in components depend on ability of the tools to detect these changes.
But how the tools cope? In this work, we have selected tools that analyse syntactic compatibility of API changes
and tested how they perform. We provide results together with the synthetic data used for the test. The data set is itself
a valuable contribution of this work as it may be used for testing future tools.

\section{Introduction}

...

In this work, we propose a dataset simulating vertical compatibility (library updates) as well as horizontal compatibility (a client provider role) first.
Then we check how successfully is incompatibility detected by existing tools with concert to both source and binary compatibility.


\section{Related Work}
In the technical domain, the term compatibility denotes\footnote{Source: the Merriam-Webster dictionary.} the ``ability to be used together'' and  ``designed to work with another device or system without modification''. Various definitions of compatibility related to software components exist, both in research \cite{canal2001compatibility,Belguidoum08formalization,taylor2009software,brada2011enhanced} % possibly stuckenholz06compatible, 
and technical \cite{forman1995release,osgi2010semvers,oracle2015compatibility} literature,
mostly dealing with the issue of either correct replacement or interoperability.

...

Overview of possible API breaking changes is collected in  \cite{EvolvingJavaAPIs:2007}.
...

Belguidoum \cite{Belguidoum08formalization} distinguishes between \textit{vertical} and \textit{horizontal} compatibility which may be respectively paraphrased as backward and client-provider compatibility. Vertical compatibility is important for library vendors if they desire to produce new versions that are backward compatible with older ones and thus library update in a system will be smooth. On the other hand, horizontal compatibility is important for a system developer who checks if a system works with a selected set of libraries.

...

\section{Background: About Compatibility}

Consequence of a wrongly selected library is potential incompatibility with
its client. The notion of compatibility is complex
as every modification of a library may influence the way other libraries can use, interact, extend, observe or substitute it, in various ways.

The Java Language Specification formally defines a notion of binary compatibility
\cite[ch. 13]{Java7Spec} that is strictly defined with respect to the static analysis performed during linking. 
It significantly differs from the notion of source compatibility which 
is checked by the compiler as the consistency between a program and a library.

What is more, binary compatibility does not implies 
source compatibility nor vice versa. For instance, specialising the return type 
of a method is source compatible as the compiler converts types, but not binary 
compatible as the linker expects exact types. On the other hand, changing generic type parameters is 
often binary compatible due to erasures, but not source compatible as the compiler checks generic parameter bounds. 

Generally speaking, the reason for this discrepancy is in different rules enforced by the linker and the compiler. 
The discrepancy increases in time as a consequence of new features included into Java. 
Whereas the compiler is enriched with new type conversions, the linker still requires exact type matching. 
For instance, boxing and unboxing has been added in Java 1.5 to make working with primitive and wrapper types transparent for programmers, but the same conversion is not part of the linker. Hence, a primitive type is something different from its wrapper type for the linker.

When a program is built and deployed, a mixed notion of compatibility is used. As the program is compiled, the source compatibility with the libraries 
is checked by the compiler. In contrary, binary compatibility among the 
libraries is checked when the program is invoked.  It may result in situations where a system may be compiled but cannot run or vice-versa.

Compatibility also depends on how a library is used, 
i.e. if a library is used (invoked) only or also implemented (used for extension in sense of the object-oriented paradigm) by the client 
program. For instance, in Java, a method added to an interface is acceptable for the client invoking this interface, but represent an 
incompatible change for someone implementing that interface as all methods must be implemented.
 
Compatibility also includes the semantics of programs. Simply said, a program is compatible with its libraries if they behave as expected, consequently causing the whole system behaving as expected. 

As handling the full compatibility from all directions is hard, simplified approaches are taken in practise. Most commonly, compatibility is checked on libraries API where a library is understood as compatible if the API is compatible with clients. In other words, it is expected that a library does not change (worsen) its behaviour as long as API is not incompatibly changed. 

Although API may be enriched with sophisticated behaviour-related annotations such as pre/post conditions \cite{liskov87data}, practical applications still rely on syntactic API expressing type system, i.e. method signatures. It allows for automation and easy verification by tools. The only question, to be answered in this work, is how current tools cope with finding API breaking changes. 





\section{API Changes Data Corpus}

Test data proposed in this work composes a corpus of possible syntactic API changes, which model evolution and releases of consequent versions of a library. 
The data are separated into eight categories to handle complexity. The categories are: access modifiers, data types, exceptions, generics, inheritance, class members, other (non-access) modifiers and borderline (uncategorised) cases. Each category is filled with examples of API change with the desire to cover all possible changes. However, the data does not have to be complete as some cases did not have to be know in the time of building the corpus, or new cases may appear as the language evolve. To cope with this, the corpus is extendable and new examples may be added.

The corpus is split into three directories: \texttt{lib-v1}, \texttt{lib-v2} and \texttt{client}. As the names suggest, the directories contain a first (original) version a library, a second (evolved) version of a library and a client application, which invokes the library. The directories model real-life scenario where a client uses libraries, but the libraries in the corpus are simplistic and contain only API with dummy implementation. In real-word a more complex back-end would be invoked behind the API instead. The client application shows possible invocation of a library, thought it does not have to be exhaustive and more cases will actually exist.

Each library as well as the client hold a set of sub-directories, Java packages, representing concrete API evaluation example. The package names are constructed following way:
\begin{verbatim}
<category><element><change>
\end{verbatim} 

Where \texttt{category} is one of the eight categories, \texttt{element} is a representation of changed element and \texttt{change} describes content of the change. For instance, a case named \texttt{dataTypeClassFieldBoxing} means that a class field changed its data types and the concrete change was boxing.

The design based on the naming convention allows for extensibility of the corpus by simply adding new cases to sub-directories (packages) following the convention. In fact, the convention is not enforced, but recommended to keep order in the relatively big number of data.

The corpus is provided in the form of source-codes with an \texttt{ant} script to build binaries. It may be invoked simply by typing \texttt{ant} from the command-line.  The script output are three JAR files named the same way as the original source directories.

The whole structure of the corpus looks as follows (\texttt{<>} is shortcut for the \texttt{<category><element><change>} triplet described above):
\begin{verbatim}
<root>
  +- client/src/<>/Main.java
  +- lib-v1/src/lib/<>/<>.java
  +- lib-v2/src/lib/<>/<>.java
  build.xml
\end{verbatim}


Although the corpus described so far may be used as such, we provide additional meta-data.
To stay up-to date when the corpus is extended, the meta-data must be generated before first usage.
A linux bash script named \texttt{compatibility.sh} and stored in the corpus root is provided to do this.
The script generates a simple CSV file with three columns: first one lists the name of a change as described above and second two columns inform respectively about source and binary compatibility. Value ``$1$'' is printed for a compatible change, ``$0$'' otherwise. 

The script generate metadata by following steps, it:
\begin{enumerate}
\item read all changes stored in the \texttt{client}, \texttt{lib-v1}, \texttt{lib-v2} directories,
\item compile the client against the original library -- it should succeed, 
\item compile the client against the updated library -- it may fail,
\item invoke the client compiled against the old library with the updated library -- it may fail,
\item write result (``1/0'') to the CSV file.
\end{enumerate}
Step 3 and 4 fail when a respective change is source or binary incompatible. The scrip reads output of these steps and generates ``1'' or ``0'' to the CSV file depending of the success status of the steps.


To sum up, we make the corpus publicly available as a GitHub project hosted at: 
\begin{verbatim}
https://github.com/kjezek/
api-evolution-data-corpus/
\end{verbatim}

Following sub-sections detail API changes separated into categories. Short discussions is provided to overview why a category is signification.

\subsection{Data Types}

Data types represent fundamental changes as they are used in the corpus for method and constructor signatures and field types. Changes of data types are also used in, generics, inheritance and exceptions and for this reason impacts other categories. 
 
We covered changes respecting general features of object-oriented paradigm, i.e. polymorphisms as well as changes particular to Java. The basic changes are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Del -- a type is removed.
\item Inst -- a type is added. 
\item Gen -- a type is generalised, i.e. moved up in an inheritance hierarchy. For instance, a \texttt{java.lang.Number} is generalisation of \texttt{java.lang.Integer}.
\item Spe -- a type is specialised, which is the opposite to the previous case.
\item Mut -- a type is changed to an incompatible one, i.e. not coming from the same inheritance tree.
\end{itemize}
Explicit cases to cover primitive types were modelled as well:
\begin{itemize}
\item Narrow -- a ``specialising'' conversion for primitive types. E.g. \texttt{long} changed to \texttt{int}.
\item Widen --  the opposite to the previous case.
\end{itemize}
Finally, Java allows for two more conversion due to simplifying work with primitive and wrapper types:
\begin{itemize}
\item Box -- a primitive type is converted to its wrapper type, e.g. \texttt{int} to \texttt{java.lang.Integer}.
\item Unbox -- a wrapper type converted to a primitive type.
\end{itemize}

Changes in this category play a different role for source and binary compatibility. In particular, \texttt{Gen}, \texttt{Spe}, \texttt{Narrow}, \texttt{Widen}, \texttt{Box} and \texttt{Unbox} are conversions performed only by the Java compiler, not the linker. It means, that they are always binary incompatible, but may be source compatible depending on usage. For instance, \texttt{Gen} is a source compatible conversion for a method parameter type, while \texttt{Spe} is compatible for a method return type. Example is a method that used to accept \texttt{java.lang.Integer} as a parameter type. It will remain compatible when it is changed to \texttt{java.lang.Number}. The opposite case holds for return types where the return type may be only specialised. Once the linker decides correct conversions, it is compiled into the byte-code and no more conversions are performed by the linker.

Changes \texttt{Del} and \texttt{Mut} are neither source nor binary compatible as no fall-back mechanism for non-existing or incompatible types is provided in Java.

\subsection{Exceptions}
Java distinguishes between so called checked and unchecked exceptions. The checked ones must be handled by a client code, either by propagation to upper levels or managed by the \texttt{try-catch} block. The unchecked exceptions are propagated automatically and may be optionally caught as well. 

It is less known that the handling of exceptions in the client code is checked only by the compiler, not the linker. 
As a consequence, changes in exceptions impact only source compatibility.
In other words, when a library method is updated so that it adds a new checked exception, the original client code cannot be compiled and it must be refactored to accommodate proper exception handling. On the other hand, if the library is used in conjunction with an already compiled client, they will link smoothly together. 

The corpus combines examples of specialised, generalised or mutated types exceptions in variants for checked and unchecked ones. 

\subsection{Generics}

Generics were added to Java relatively late in version 1.5 with strong regard to compatibility with previous Java version. Their employment had required several simplifications, most noticeably so called \textit{erasures}. Generics are erased during the compilation from the caller site and their persist only on the target side. When the linker searches for types, it works as if only raw types without generics were used. 

Whereas a client code is checked by the compiler to correctly use generic types, a binary code that uses generics may be combined with the code not using generics thanks to erasures. The impact to compatibility is evident. A lot of changes that are binary compatible do not have to be source compatible. 

A typical example are bounds of a parametrized type: for instance, if a list is defined as \texttt{java.util.List<String>} only \texttt{String} values may be added and the compiler checks it. However, when the definition is changed to \texttt{java.util.List<Number>} and  only binaries updated, the system will successfully link. Let us note, that such a program will likely fail later on a \texttt{ClassCastException}, but strictly from the compatibility point of view, such a change is compatible. 

\subsection{Inheritance}

Inheritance is sometimes not considered at all in respect to compatibility and some best practices discourage implementations/extensions of API classes. The reason is that API must be almost frozen to be backward compatible also for inheritance. 

Some changes such as removed methods clearly break compatibility, but some breaking changes are less evident. Addition of an method to interface is an obvious example, which breaks compilation of clients implementing this interface. A possible compatibility issue of making a method more visible is, however, less obvious. In detail, changing visibility e.g. from \texttt{private} to \texttt{public} may seem harmless, but the new public method may overlap with the same method in a sub-class. When the sub-class method has a stricter access, the compilation also fails as the access cannot be weakened through inheritance. As a result, more accessible method may break compatibility when inheritance is used while it is always compatible for only invoked API.

Since the changes possibly impacting inheritance are partly covered by other categories (method, modifier, types etc. changes), this category contributes to the corpus with several more examples with class/interface definitions modified in a sub-class. Several examples with methods moved up and down in the hierarchy tree are provided as well.

\subsection{Members}

Members are elements defined in a Java class including fields, methods and constructors. This category contains examples of removed or added members that have expected impact on compatibility: removed elements are always incompatible, added elements may be incompatible for inheritance of abstract methods as discussed above. 

The problem of added abstract/interface methods is addressed in Java 1.8 by providing default methods. We include such examples in the data set.

\subsection{Access Modifiers}

Access modifiers may be either weakened or strengthened and may be applied to a constructor, a method, a field, a class and an interface. These combinations are reflected in the corpus. 

A change making an element more accessible is a compatible change while restricting the access is incompatible, which does not differ for source and binary compatibility. The exception is inheritance of a method with a weaker access as already discussed. However, such cases are likely very rare.

\subsection{Other Modifiers}

Other, non-access, modifiers have various purposes in Java and for this reason have different impact to compatibility. Some of the modifier such as \texttt{volatile}, \texttt{transient}, \texttt{native} or \texttt{strictfp} are denoted to specific treatment of respective elements, \texttt{final} or \texttt{abstract} are used in conjunction with inheritance, and \texttt{static} deals with access context. Sometimes one modifier is used for multiple purposes, e.g. \texttt{final} fields are used as constants, while \texttt{final} classes cannot be inherited. 

There is no pattern how these modifiers impact compatibility. For instance, a tagging modifier \texttt{transient} does not break compatibility while \texttt{native} does. It is because \texttt{native} requires a special treatment by JVM while \texttt{transient} is only a meta-information. Modifiers \texttt{final} and \texttt{abstract} have obvious effect as their adding or removing may negatively break inheriting classes. Interesting is \texttt{static} modifier that may be in certain cases source compatible and binary incompatible. In particular, static elements, fields and methods, may be invoked from non-static context (via a reference) and pass the compilation. However, this combination is allowed at runtime as different byte-code instructions are generated for static and non-static access.

\subsection{Borderline Cases}

Java contains several specific features that are commonly grouped here. Notoriously know is implicit inheritance of \texttt{java.lang.Object}  by any classes.  Maybe less known is that any Java array by defaults implements \texttt{java.lang.Cloneable} and \texttt{java.lang.Serialisable}. Consequence is that possible specialisation between user classes and these classes must be taken into account when deciding compatibility.

Another example in this category in a change from class to interface or vice-versa. It is interesting because invocation of methods does not differ between class and interface methods in the source-code. However, different byte-code instructions are generated leading to another discrepancy between source and binary compatibility. In other words, when a library class is changed to an interface or vice-versa, the client invoking methods from this interface/class may be recompiled, but cannot be linked without recompilation.


\section{Tools Challenge}

We searched for tools that are capable of discovering API syntactic backward compatibility and included them into this work. They are listed in Table \ref{tab:tools} together with basic information about their authors, current versions, licensing and basic usages. All these tools were benchmarked to find out how they cope with finding incompatibilities, results are provided below.

\end{table*}

\subsection{Methodology}

The tools were tested using following approach: we generated the meta-data with incompatibility classification first, then we extracted only meta-data that represent incompatibility. After that, we invoked all the tools and redirected their output to text files. In certain cases we removed lines from outputs representing a compatible change. Finally, we iterated the meta-data with incompatibilities and used string matching to detected changes in tools outputs. We collected the results in a CSV file with ``$1$'' meaning a correctly detected incompatibility and ``$0$'' meaning that a tool did not find the incompatibility.

The lines with compatible changes were removed from the meta-data to prevent false negatives.
We had to analyse only provably incompatible changes because the current client does not handle all possible cases. An incompatible usage not expressed in the client may exist and if detected by a tool, it would not match with the expected compatibility leading to a wrong result. 

The lines with compatible changes were removed from the tools outputs to prevent false positives. 
Some of the tools list all API they crawled with additional compatibility classification. It could cause an incorrect string matching if a change not recognised as incompatible were listed in the output. This step differs for each tool. Some of the tools output only incompatibilities and do not have to be corrected (japichecker, japicc) while some have to. Usually such lines can be easily caught by a simple regular expression as they contain representative strings such as \texttt{!} (japicmp), \texttt{100\% Compatible} (japitool), \texttt{NON\_BREAKING} (revapi), \texttt{INFO} (clirr) etc.  

\subsection{Extendability}
The whole process is automated and may be invoked by a bash script \texttt{./benchmark.sh}. The script prepares the meta-data, invokes the tools, corrects outputs and analyse results. It delegates invocation of the tools to the script \texttt{tools/run.sh}, which executes all tools one-by-one.

For instance, the \texttt{run.sh} script contains following lines to invoke japicmp:
\begin{verbatim}
REPORTS=".reports"
java -jar japicmp/japicmp-0.7.2.jar \
  -o ../lib-v1.jar \
  -n ../lib-v2.jar \
  -a private > "$REPORTS"/japicmp.txt
  
grep -v '===  UNCHANGED' \
  "$REPORTS"/japicmp.txt > japicmp.txt.tmp 
mv japicmp.txt.tmp "$REPORTS"/japicmp.txt   
\end{verbatim}

The new tools may be added to the benchmark simply by adding invocable lines to this script. 
The script can contain any bash invocable lines that lead to execution of a tool and must be able to produce a textual output stored in the \texttt{tools/.reports}.

The structure of the corpus including the tools benchmark looks like:
\begin{verbatim}
<root>
  +- client/src/<>/Main.java
  +- lib-v1/src/lib/<>/<>.java
  +- lib-v2/src/lib/<>/<>.java
  +- tools/.reports
  +- tools/<tool>
  +- tools/run.sh
  build.xml
  compatibility.sh
  benchmark.sh
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Results}

The benchamrk has shown that the tools widely differ in their ability to find compatibility breaking changes. Results are provided in Table \ref{tab:result-categories}
as percentages of successfully detected compatibility breaking changes. They are separated to categories with a summary in the last row. 

While the results show clearly that the worst tool is \texttt{clirr} and the best is \texttt{sigtest}, detailed analysis reveal that \texttt{clirr} may be a better choice in certain use-cases than other better performing tools.

\texttt{Clirr} is the worst performing tool, which is however not actively developed since 2005, and evidently does not recognize generics and exceptions. However, it works well in other categories and may be still useful for detecting only binary incompatible changes as generics and exceptions impacts only srouce compatibility.
Similar situation appears for \texttt{japicmp} overall showing a poor result, which is however caused by unsporting generics and a few bugs in detecting modifiers. Otherwise, the tool works well.

The second place is occupied by \texttt{japitool} which also seems to be no more developed since 2006, thought still available as part of Linux distributions (Debian/Linux in particular).

Tools  such as \texttt{japicc} or \texttt{revapi} showed overall better score, but they have several issues scattered among categories. They may be less reliable in production as they can miss important issues in both categories of source and binary compatibility, while worse performing tools like \texttt{clirr} or \texttt{japicmp} may be a better choice when source compatibility is out of interest. Nonetheless, both tools are still developed and may be thus improved in the future. 


\texttt{Sigtest} wins the benchmark as it is able to detect almost all problems. It fails only in two changes, detection of the removed \texttt{strictfp} modifier and addition of the \texttt{native} modifier, which are both binary incompatible. As they are very specific modifiers, we do not expect their frequent changes among library versions. For this reason, \texttt{sigtest} may serve as the most reliable tool from this benchmark.
  
Table \ref{tab:result-types} provides insight into results separated for source and binary incompatibilities. First line shows changes that are only source incompatible and binary compatible. The second line in contrast lists changes that are binary incompatible, but may be either source compatible or incompatible. 
We separated the data this way to test the tools specifically for source compatibility and for the rest as we wanted to detect how the tools deal with source compatibility. 

The table provides interesting results, the tools perform much better in detecting binary incompatibilities.  Worst in this category is \texttt{revapi} while most of the tools detected more than $90\%$ of issues. On the other hand, the tools lack ability to detect source incompatibility. The only actually reliable tools are \texttt{sigtest} and \texttt{japitool} that correctly recognised all source incompatibilities. Partly useful is \texttt{revapi} with about 88\% of successful results.  Other tools detected only a small number of problems and cannot be recommended for industry level usage.

Non-functional properties such as easiness of usage is nonetheless important in recommending the tools. A tool with a few bugs may be a better choice if it provides a better user comfort. While we did not measured it systematically in this work, we observer usage and output of the tools. It must be said that the tools are very similar in this aspect. All provide CLI with a few options to input JAR files and print out a human readable formatted TXT output. We see non of the formats particularly better then another one. One exception is \texttt{japicc} which provides a HTML output classifying severity of changes, which may be a better readable by humans and especially by non-programmers. 

To summarize, the experiment shows that the most usable tool is \texttt{sigtest}, which is distributed as open-source and may be easily integrated into development process via CLI, Maven or Ant plugin. A small drawback may be that it produces only a TXT output, which makes it less convenient for third-party integrations. Furthermore, it was detected that other tools are in reality usable only for checking binary compatibility. Nonetheless, it may be sufficient in many scenarios as library updates are usually distributed in binary forms.  Hence, binary compatibility checking may help find the most unpredictable runtime failures caused by opaque third-party libraries. 
Although a source incompatible change may break a system as well, it is detectable by project build early in the development phase and thus less harmful.
