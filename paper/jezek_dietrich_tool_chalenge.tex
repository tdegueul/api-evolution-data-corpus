\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.

% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
Development of independently released software components is nowadays widely supported by tools.
Among other benefits, the tools help guarantee backward compatibility of new versions of components. 
In other words, non-breaking changes in components depend on ability of the tools to detect breaking changes.
But how the tools cope? In this work, we have selected tools that analyse syntactic compatibility of API changes
and tested how they perform. We provide results together with the test data used for the test. The data itself
are also valuable contribution of this work as they may be used for testing future tools.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Background: About Compatibility}

In the technical domain, the term compatibility denotes\footnote{Source: the Merriam-Webster dictionary.} the ``ability to be used together'' and  ``designed to work with another device or system without modification''. Various definitions of compatibility related to software components exist, both in research \cite{canal2001compatibility,Belguidoum08formalization,taylor2009software,brada2011enhanced} % possibly stuckenholz06compatible, 
and technical \cite{forman1995release,osgi2010semvers,oracle2015compatibility} literature,
mostly dealing with the issue of either correct replacement or interoperability.

The consequence of a wrongly selected library is potential incompatibility with
its client. The notion of compatibility itself is complex
as every modification of a library may influence the way other libraries can use, interact, extend, observe or substitute it, in various ways.

The Java Language Specification formally defines a notion of binary compatibility
\cite[ch. 13]{Java7Spec} that is strictly defined with respect to the static analysis performed during linking. 
This significantly differs from the notion of source compatibility which 
is the consistency between a program and a library checked by the compiler. 
Specifically in Java, binary compatibility does not implies 
source compatibility and vice versa. For instance, specialising the return type 
of a method is source compatible for a client using this method, but not binary 
compatible. On the other hand, changing generic type parameters of a class is 
often binary compatible due to erasure, but not source compatible as the 
compiler checks generics' bounds. 

Compatibility also depends on how a library is used, 
i.e. if a library is used (invoked) only or also implemented (used for extension in sense of the object-oriented paradigm) by the client 
program. In other words, adding a method to a Java interface may be acceptable for the client invoking this interface but represent an 
incompatible change for someone implementing that interface as all methods must be implemented.
 
Compatibility also includes the semantics of programs. It means that a program is compatible with its libraries if they behave as expected, consequently causing the whole system behaving as expected. As handling the full compatibility is hard, simplified approaches are taken in practise. Most commonly compatibility is checked on libraries API where a library is understood as compatible when its API is compatible with clients. In other words, it is expected that a library does not change (worsen) its behaviour as long as API is not incompatibly changed. 

Although API may be enriched with sophisticated behaviour-related annotations such as pre/post conditions \cite{liskov87data}, practical applications still rely on syntactic API expressing type system, i.e. method signatures. Overview of possible API breaking changes is collected in  \cite{EvolvingJavaAPIs:2007}.
When a program is built and deployed, a mixed notion of compatibility is used. As the program is compiled, the source compatibility with the libraries 
is checked by the compiler. In contrary, binary compatibility among the 
libraries is checked when the program is invoked.  It may result in situations where a system may be compiled but cannot run or vice-versa.

Belguidoum \cite{Belguidoum08formalization} distinguishes between \textit{vertical} and \textit{horizontal} compatibility which may be respectively paraphrased as backward and client-provider compatibility. Vertical compatibility is important for library vendors if they desire to produce new versions that are backward compatible with older ones and thus library update in a system will be smooth. On the other hand, horizontal compatibility is important for a system developer who checks if a system works with a selected set of libraries.

In this work, we target vertical compatibility expressed via API syntax, concerning both source and binary compatibility.



\section{API Changes Data Corpus}

Test data proposed in this work composes a corpus of possible syntactic API changes, which model evolution and releases of consequent versions of a library. 
The data are separated into eight categories to handle complexity. The categories are: access modifiers, data types, exceptions, generics, inheritance, class members, other (non-access) modifiers and borderline (uncategorised) cases. Each category is filled with examples of API change with the desire to cover all possible changes. However, the data does not have to be complete as some cases did not have to be know in the time of building the corpus, or new cases may appear as the language evolve. For this reason, the corpus is designed to be easily extended by simply adding new examples to respective directories.

The corpus is split into three directories: \texttt{lib-v1}, \texttt{lib-v2} and \texttt{client}. As the names suggest, the directories respectively contain a first (original) version of an API, a second (evolved) version of an API and a client application, which invokes the API. The directories model nowadays practise where applications are constructed so that a client uses libraries. However, the libraries in the corpus are simplistic and represent only API with very primitive implementations. They simplify real-word cases where a more complex back-end logic would be invoked behind the API. The client application is provided to show possible invocation of a library, thought it does not have to be exhaustive and more cases may actually exist.

Each library as well as the client hold a set of sub-directories, Java packages, representing concrete API evaluation examples. The names are constructed following way:
\begin{verbatim}
<category><element><change>
\end{verbatim} 

Where \texttt{category} is one of the eight categories, \texttt{element} is a representation of changed element and \texttt{change} describes content of the change. For instance, a case named \texttt{dataTypeClassFieldBoxing} means that a class field changed its data types and the concrete change was boxing.

The design based on the naming convention allows for extensibility of the corpus by simply adding new cases following the convention. In fact, the convention is not enforced, but recommended to keep order in the relatively big number of data.

The corpus contains an \texttt{ant} script in its root directory to build the source data into JAR files. It may be invoked simply by typing \texttt{ant} from the command-line.  The script output are three JAR files named the same way as the original source directories.

Although the corpus described so far may be used as such, we provide additional meta-data with convenient information for third-party usage in a form of a simple CSV file. The file has three columns: first one lists the name of a change as described above and second two columns inform respectively about source and binary compatibility of the change. Value ``$1$'' is printed for a compatible change, ``$0$'' otherwise. To have up-to date meta-data in the case the corpus is extended, the meta-data are generated by a script provided within the corpus and may be re-generated when the corpus changes. The script may be invoked by typing \texttt{./compatibility.sh} from the command-line.

The script works as follows: first, it automatically reads all changes stored in the three directories. Secondly, the script tries to compile the client against the original library and then against the updated library. After that, it tries to invoke the client compiled against the old library with the updated library. This process should always succeed with the original library as it represents a compatibility. On the other hand, it does not have to succeed with the updated library as it represents a potential incompatibility. The result is reflected in the CSV file showing information about backward compatibility of each update.


We make the corpus available as a GitHub project hosted at:

\section{Tools Challenge}

We searched for tools that are capable of discovering API syntactic backward compatibility and included them into this work. They are listed in Table \ref{tab:tools} together with basic information about their authors, current versions, licensing and basic usages. All these tools were benchmarked to find out how they cope with finding incompatibilities. Results are provided in this section.

\end{table*}

\subsection{Methodology}

The tools were tested using following approach: we generated the meta-data with incompatibility classification first, then we extracted only the lines that represent incompatibility. We also invoked all the tools and redirected their output to text files. In certain cases we removed outputs representing a compatible change. Finally, we iterated the meta-data with incompatibilities and used string matching to find successfully detected incompatible changes in the tools output. We collected the results in a CSV file with ``$1$'' meaning a correctly detected incompatibility and ``$0$'' meaning that a tool did not find the incompatibility.

The lines with compatible changes were removed from the meta-data because they represent only compatibility in the context of current \texttt{client.jar}. In opposite, an incompatible usage not handled by the client may exist and could be consequently detected by a tool. For this reason, we analysed only provably incompatible changes to prevent false negatives. 

The lines with compatible changes were removed from the output tools to match only with incompatible meta-data and prevent false positives when a tool lists a change, but actually did not detected that the change is incompatible. This step depends on each tool. Some of the tools output only incompatibilities and do not have to be corrected (japichecker, japicc) while some have to. Usually such lines can be easily caught by a simple regular expression as they contain representative strings such as \texttt{UNCHANGED} (japicmp), \texttt{100\% Compatible} (japitool), \texttt{NON\_BREAKING} (revapi), \texttt{INFO} (clirr) etc.  

The whole process is automated and may be invoked by a script \texttt{./benchmark.sh}. The script prepares the meta-data, invokes the tools and analyse results. It delegates invocation of the tools to the script \texttt{tools/run.sh}, which executes all tools one-by-one.

The new tools may be added to the benchmark simply by adding invocable lines to the \texttt{run.sh} script. 
The script can contain any bash invocable lines that lead to execution of a tool. 
The only limitation is that the tool must be able to produce a textual output, which is stored in the \texttt{tools/.reports} directory and filtered to reveal only incompatibilities as described above.

\subsection{Results}

Benchamrk shows that the tools widely differ in their ability to find compatibility breaking changes. Results are provided in Table \ref{tab:result-categories}
as percentages of successfully detected changes. Results are separated to categories with a summary in the last row.

As it may be seen, the worst performing is \texttt{clirr}, which is however not actively developed since 2005. Evidently \texttt{clirr} does not recognize generics and exceptions, but works well in other categories and may be still useful for detecting binary incompatible changes.
Similar situation appears for \texttt{japicmp} listed with a relatively poor result, which is however caused by unsporting generics and a few bugs in detecting modifiers. Otherwise, the tool is very reliable in other categories. 

Interestingly, the second place is occupied by \texttt{japitool} which also seems to be no more developed since 2006, thought still available.

Tools  such as \texttt{japicc} or \texttt{revapi} showed overall better score, but they have several issues scattered among categories. For this reason, they may be less reliable in production as they can miss important issues. Since both tools are still developed, they may be improved in the future. 


\texttt{Sigtest} wins the benchmark as it is able to detect almost all problems. It fails only in two changes, detection of the removed \texttt{strictfp} modifier and addition of the \texttt{native} modifier, which are both binary incompatible. As they are very specific modifiers, we do not expect their frequent changes among library versions. For this reason, \texttt{sigtest} may serve as the most reliable tool from this benchmark.
  
Table \ref{tab:result-types} provides insight into results separated for source and binary incompatibilities. First line shows changes that are only source incompatible and binary compatible. The second line in contrast lists changes that are binary incompatible, but may be either source compatible or incompatible. 
We separated data into these categories to detect how the tools cope with source incompatibilities and how they cope with the rest. The table provides interesting insight, the tools perform much better in detecting binary incompatibilities.  Worst in this category is \texttt{revapi} while most of the tools detected more than $90\%$ of issues. On the other hand, the tools lack ability to detect source incompatibility. The only actually reliable tools are \texttt{sigtest} and \texttt{japitool}, partly \texttt{revapi}. 

To summarize, the experiment shows that the most usable tool is \texttt{sigtest}, which is distributed as open-source and may be easily integrated into development process via CLI, Maven or Ant plugin. A small drawback may be that it produces only a TXT output, which makes it less convenient for third-party integrations. Furthermore, it was detected that other tools are in reality usable only for checking binary compatibility. Nonetheless, it may be the case in a lot of scenarios as library updates are usually in binary forms and units of checks.  Hence, binary compatibility checking may be often sufficient as it finds the most unpredictable failures caused by opaque third-party libraries of which updates are difficult to handle.  
Although a source incompatible change may break a system as well, it is detectable by project build early in the development phase and thus less harmful.
